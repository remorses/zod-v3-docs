# Fumabase Starter Kit

### Development

## 1. Install the Fumabase CLI

To preview your documentation changes locally, first install the [Fumabase CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fumabase). Use the following command:

```
npm i -g fumabase
```

## 2. Start the Local Development Server

At the root of your documentation project (where `fumabase.jsonc` is located), start the development server with:

```
fumabase dev
```

### Publishing Changes

## 3. Set Up Automatic Deployments

Install our GitHub App to enable automated deployments from your repository. After pushing changes to your default branch, your documentation will be deployed to production automatically. You can find the installation link on your dashboard.
