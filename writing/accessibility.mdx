# Writing Accessible Documentation

Accessible documentation isn't just about compliance‚Äîit creates better experiences for all users by prioritizing clarity, structure, and multiple ways to consume information.

## Clear Language and Structure

Accessible writing starts with clear, direct language that reduces cognitive load for all readers.

### Write for Clarity

Use simple, direct language that communicates efficiently:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown ‚ùå Complex Language
Subsequently, in order to implement the aforementioned functionality,
it is necessary to instantiate the configuration object with the
appropriate parameters as delineated in the following example.
```

```markdown ‚úÖ Clear Language
Next, create a configuration object with these settings:
```

</CodeGroup>

### Meaningful Headings

Write headings that describe content accurately and help users navigate efficiently:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Poor Headings">
```markdown
# Introduction
## Getting Started
## More Information
## Advanced Stuff
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Descriptive Headings">
```markdown
# User Authentication Setup
## Installing the Authentication SDK
## Configuring Your First Login Flow
## Handling Authentication Errors
## Multi-Factor Authentication Options
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
    **Screen Reader Test:** Read only your headings aloud. Can someone
    understand your document structure and find what they need?
</Tip>

## Alternative Text and Media

Provide meaningful descriptions for all visual content so information isn't lost for users who can't see images.

### Effective Alt Text

Write alt text that conveys the same information the image provides:

<Steps>
<Step title="Describe the purpose, not appearance">
    Focus on what information the image conveys, not how it looks.

    ```markdown
    ‚ùå "Screenshot of a dashboard"
    ‚úÖ "Dashboard showing 3 active integrations, 1,247 API calls today,
        and 99.8% uptime status"
    ```

</Step>

<Step title="Include relevant text content">
    If the image contains important text, include it in the alt text.

    ```markdown
    ‚ùå "Error message dialog box"
    ‚úÖ "Error dialog stating 'Invalid API key. Please check your
        configuration and try again.' with a retry button"
    ```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Video and Interactive Content

Provide text alternatives for multimedia content:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Video transcripts">
Include complete transcripts for instructional videos:

```markdown
## Video: Setting Up Webhooks (3:42)

[Full transcript available]

**0:00 - 0:15** Introduction: "In this video, we'll configure webhooks
to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your application."

**0:16 - 0:45** Navigate to dashboard: "First, log into your dashboard
and click the 'Webhooks' tab in the sidebar. You'll see a list of
existing webhooks or an empty state if this is your first time."

**0:46 - 1:20** Creating a webhook: "Click 'Add Webhook' and enter your
endpoint URL. This should be a publicly accessible HTTPS URL that can
receive POST requests..."
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Interactive demonstrations">
Provide step-by-step text instructions alongside interactive demos:

```markdown
## Interactive Demo: API Testing

Try our live API explorer below, or follow these equivalent steps:

1. **Set your API key:** Enter your test key in the authorization field
2. **Choose an endpoint:** Select 'GET /users' from the dropdown
3. **Add parameters:** Set limit=10 for the first 10 users
4. **Send request:** Click 'Execute' to see the live response
5. **Review response:** Examine the returned JSON structure

[Interactive API Explorer Component]
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Logical Content Structure

Organize information in a predictable hierarchy that assistive technologies can navigate effectively.

### Consistent Navigation Patterns

Use consistent patterns throughout your documentation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Page Structure" icon="layout">
- Page title (H1)
- Introduction paragraph
- Main sections (H2)
- Subsections (H3)
- Code examples
- Next steps
</Card>

<Card title="Section Patterns" icon="list">
- Descriptive heading
- Brief overview
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code example
- Expected outcome
- Troubleshooting
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Skip Links and Landmarks

Help users navigate efficiently through content:

<Info>
    **Navigation Strategy:** Users with screen readers often navigate by
    headings, landmarks, or links. Ensure your content structure supports these
    navigation methods.
</Info>

## Color and Visual Accessibility

Don't rely solely on color to convey important information.

### Color-Independent Information Design

Use multiple visual cues to communicate status and importance:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown ‚ùå Color-Only Indicators
‚ùå Red text: "Error occurred"
üü° Yellow text: "Warning message"
‚úÖ Green text: "Success"
```

```markdown ‚úÖ Multiple Visual Cues
‚ùå **Error:** Invalid API key provided
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Rate limit approaching (80% used)
‚úÖ **Success:** Configuration saved successfully
```

</CodeGroup>

### High Contrast Content

Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds:

<Warning>
    **Contrast Requirements:** Text should have at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio
    against its background. Large text (18pt+) needs at least 3:1 contrast.
</Warning>

## Keyboard Navigation Support

Ensure all interactive elements work with keyboard navigation:

### Focus Management

Design content flow that makes sense when navigating with keyboard:

<Steps>
<Step title="Logical tab order">
    Interactive elements should follow reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

    ```markdown
    ## API Key Configuration

    1. [Input field: API Key]
    2. [Button: Test Connection]
    3. [Button: Save Configuration]
    4. [Link: Advanced Settings]
    ```

</Step>

<Step title="Clear focus indicators">
    Users should always know which element has focus.

    <Note>
    **Focus Indicators:** Ensure buttons, links, and form fields have visible focus states that are clearly distinguishable.
    </Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Skip links for efficiency">
    Provide ways to skip repetitive content.

    ```html
    <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">
        Skip to main content
    </a>
    ```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Content

Regularly test your documentation with accessibility tools and real users:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Automated Testing">
```bash
# Test with accessibility scanners
npm install -g @axe-core/cli
axe-cli https://your-docs-site.com

# Check color contrast

npm install -g colour-contrast-checker
contrast-checker "#333333" "#ffffff"

````
</Tab>

<Tab title="Manual Testing">
**Keyboard Navigation Test:**
1. Unplug your mouse
2. Navigate your entire documentation using only keyboard
3. Can you access all information and functionality?

**Screen Reader Test:**
1. Enable your OS screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows)
2. Navigate through your content
3. Is all information available audibly?
</Tab>

<Tab title="User Testing">
**Include Diverse Users:**
- Users with visual impairments
- Users with motor disabilities
- Users with cognitive differences
- Users with limited technical experience

**Ask Specific Questions:**
- Can you find how to authenticate API requests?
- What steps would you take if you got an error?
- Is any information unclear or confusing?
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Error Messages and Help Text

Write error messages and help text that are clear and actionable:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Specific error descriptions">
```javascript
‚ùå "Authentication failed"
‚úÖ "Authentication failed: API key is missing or invalid.
    Check that you've included the Authorization header
    with format 'Bearer your-api-key'"
````

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Recovery instructions'>
    ```javascript ‚ùå "Network error occurred" ‚úÖ "Network error: Unable to
    connect to API server. Check your internet connection and try again. If the
    problem persists, check our status page at status.example.com" ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Helpful context">
```javascript
‚ùå "Invalid format"
‚úÖ "Invalid email format: Please enter a valid email address
    like 'user@example.com'. Special characters are allowed
    in the local part (before @)."
```
