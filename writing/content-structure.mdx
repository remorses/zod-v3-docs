# Content Structure That Works

Great documentation isn't just about having the right information—it's about organizing that information so users can find and understand it quickly.

## Start with User Intent

Before writing a single word, understand what your users are trying to accomplish. Are they trying to solve a problem, learn a concept, or complete a task?

<Tip>
Always lead with the outcome. Tell users what they'll achieve before explaining how to do it.
</Tip>

### The Inverted Pyramid Approach

Structure your content like a news article—most important information first, supporting details after.

<Steps>
<Step title="Lead with the outcome">
    Start each section by describing what the user will accomplish or learn.

    ```markdown
    # Setting Up Authentication

    By the end of this guide, you'll have secure API authentication
    working in your application with proper error handling.
    ```
</Step>

<Step title="Provide essential context">
    Give users the background they need to understand the instructions.

    <Note>
    Include prerequisites, assumptions, and any important warnings upfront.
    </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Detail the implementation">
    Break down the actual steps, code examples, and configuration details.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Progressive Information Disclosure

Reveal complexity gradually. Start with the simplest case that works, then build up to more sophisticated scenarios.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Example">
```javascript
// Start with the minimal working example
const response = await fetch('/api/users');
const users = await response.json();
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="With Error Handling">
```javascript
// Then show error handling
try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/users');
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const users = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch users:', error);
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Production Ready">
```javascript
// Finally, show production-ready implementation
const fetchUsers = async (options = {}) => {
    const { timeout = 5000, retries = 3 } = options;

    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
        try {
            const controller = new AbortController();
            const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);

            const response = await fetch('/api/users', {
                signal: controller.signal,
                headers: {
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${getToken()}`,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                }
            });

            clearTimeout(timeoutId);

            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
            }

            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempt === retries) throw error;
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * attempt));
        }
    }
};
```
</Tab>

## Scannable Content Design

Most users scan before they read. Design your content to support this behavior.

### Effective Heading Hierarchy

Use headings to create a clear content outline:

```markdown
# Main Topic (H1)
## Primary Sections (H2)
### Subsections (H3)
#### Details (H4 - use sparingly)
```

<Warning>
Never skip heading levels. Going from H2 to H4 breaks screen readers and confuses users.
</Warning>

### Strategic Use of Lists

Break up dense text with lists when you have:
- Multiple related items
- Sequential steps
- Options or alternatives
- Key points to emphasize

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="When to use numbered lists">
Use numbered lists for:
- Sequential procedures
- Ranked items
- References to specific steps
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When to use bullet points">
Use bullet points for:
- Related but unordered items
- Feature lists
- Benefits or advantages
- Non-sequential information
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Context and Prerequisites

Never assume users have the same context you do. Explicitly state what they need to know or have ready.

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Good Example
# Installing the CLI Tool

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic familiarity with command line

**What you'll need:**
- API key from your dashboard
- 10 minutes to complete setup
```

```markdown title="Poor Example"
# Installing the CLI Tool

Just run the install command and configure your API key.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps Navigation

End each section by guiding users to their next logical action.
